```bash
curl -X POST https://dualpay.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/otto/appointment-request \

5. **‚è∞ Wait 1 minute**
6. **After 1 min**: Sends reminder SMS: "Reminder: Your appointment is tomorrow"
7. **After 1 min**: Makes voice call from +18884118568

## Troubleshooting

### SMS Still Failing?
You need to fix the "Validate & Clean Data" node first:

1. Open that node in n8n
2. Switch from **Manual Mapping** to **JSON** mode
3. Replace code with:
```javascript
return {
  customer: {
    phone: items[0].json.phone,
    name: items[0].json.name,
    email: items[0].json.email
  },
  intent: {
    preferredDate: items[0].json.date,
    preferredTime: items[0].json.time,
    appointmentType: items[0].json.appointmentType
  },
  notes: items[0].json.notes
};
```
4. Save and test again

### Voice Call Not Coming?
- Check if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set (see ELEVENLABS_SETUP.md)
- Verify Twilio number +18884118568 can make calls
- Check n8n execution log for "Make Follow-up Call" node errors

### Execution Stops at Wait Node?
- If you set to 1 minute, execution will pause for 1 minute (this is normal)
- Check back after the wait period
- Or remove the wait entirely for instant testing

## After Testing: Restore 24 Hour Wait

Once you've verified everything works:

1. Re-add or re-connect the **"Wait 24 Hours"** node
2. Change duration back to **24 hours** (or **1 day**)
3. Save workflow
4. Now production appointments will get follow-up calls 24 hours later

## Production vs Test Workflows

**Consider creating two workflows:**

1. **Production**: `otto-appointment-booking`
   - Webhook: `/webhook/otto/appointment-request`
   - Wait: 24 hours
   - For real customer appointments

2. **Test**: `otto-appointment-booking-test`
   - Webhook: `/webhook-test/otto/appointment-request`
   - Wait: 1 minute (or none)
   - For your testing

This way you can test without affecting production!
