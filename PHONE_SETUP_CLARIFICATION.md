# ElevenLabs Phone Integration - Updated Info

## Current Situation

✅ **Inbound**: +18884118568 receives calls → ElevenLabs Otto answers
❌ **Outbound**: API endpoint needs verification

---

## ElevenLabs Phone Integration Methods

### Option 1: Phone Number Management Dashboard

If +18884118568 is a **ElevenLabs-managed number**:

1. Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Click on your agent: `agent_3701k70bz4gcfd6vq1bkh57d15bw`
3. Check "Phone Integration" section
4. There should be options for:
   - **Inbound calls** (already working)
   - **Outbound calls** (may need to enable)

### Option 2: Twilio + ElevenLabs WebSocket

The way we had it set up in `server.js` is actually correct for **Twilio-initiated calls**:

**How it works**:
1. Twilio makes the call using a **verified Twilio number**
2. When customer answers, Twilio connects to your webhook
3. Your server returns TwiML with ElevenLabs WebSocket connection
4. Call streams to ElevenLabs Otto AI for conversation

**Problem**: You need a **verified Twilio number** to initiate the call
